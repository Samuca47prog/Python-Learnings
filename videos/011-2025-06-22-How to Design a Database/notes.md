# How to Design a Database

## Introduction

We start from an idea or set of requirements and will turn it into a database design.

* How will the data be stored?
* Determine the tables and attributes


## Step 1: Write it down

Write small sentenses about what you want to do.

Examples:
![Alt text](images\network_app.png)

The following example:
![Alt text](images\doctor.png)


## Step 2: Identify nouns

Nouns for doctor example are:
- Patient
- Doctor
- Clinic
- Appointment

## Step 3: Add attributes

Add them based in the sentences, thinking about use cases and interacting with other people.

## Step 5: Assess tables, fields and relationships

Read the sentences of step 1 again and assess if they fit in the current database design.
